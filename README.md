## LexCMS

LexCMS (Light Extendable Content Managment System) is a work in progresss that attempts to create a CMS that follows a few simple ideals (very experimental, they could be very wrong :-) ):
1. Code should stay in the _Code Base_
2. No more rolling out upgrades. Automatic code pulls will pull in the most recent system and module code. Patches for custom content will be issued as necessary.
